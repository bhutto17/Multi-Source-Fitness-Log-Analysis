# Multi-Source-Fitness-Log-Analysis

## Data Access

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [PMData: A Sports Logging Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vlbthambawita/pmdata-a-sports-logging-dataset) on Kaggle. This dataset contains multi-source fitness logging data from 16 participants collected over several months.

To download and prepare the dataset for analysis, you can use the provided Jupyter Notebook:

### How to Download the Data
1. **Open the `notebooks/data_download.ipynb`** file in this repository.
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Mount Google Drive (if using Colab).
   - Install and set up the Kaggle API for data download.
   - Download the dataset directly from Kaggle.
   - Unzip the dataset and make it ready for further analysis.

### Note:
- The dataset is quite large (over 4GB) and cannot be uploaded directly to this repository. You will need to set up your Kaggle API credentials to download it.
- For instructions on setting up the Kaggle API, refer to the [Kaggle API documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api).

Once you have successfully downloaded the dataset, you can proceed with the analysis and visualization steps outlined in the subsequent notebooks.
